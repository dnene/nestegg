On-demand, lightweight, package building pypi mirror

Features 
--------

.. note :: 

  Still in early stages, though has enough features for me to use it

**Implemented**

* *Pypi like repository*: For software you author or python libraries you modify but only publish internally
* *Pypi Mirror*: Mirrors packages from pypi.python.org. 
  * *On demand*: Packages are downloaded only when requested for. 
  * *Lightweight*: Downloads and mirrors only those versions requested for.

**TODO**

* **Continuous integration**: Test all defined source builds at defined intervals and/or based on git / hg commits. Offer readonly web based interface to past tests and results
* Apache integration using mod_wsgi
* Refresh pypi packages and indices
* Additional python versions (currently tested only with python 3.3)

Quick start
-----------

* Create and activate a python virtual environment

  * Currently only tested with python version 3.3. Additional versions to be added later

* Install package::

    $ pip install nestegg

* Create configuration file for nestegg in your home directory `$HOME/nestegg.yml` ::

.. code:: yml

  nestegg:
    nestegg_dir: /var/cache/nestegg                         # Where nestegg makes a nest
    port: 7654                                              # Port to run on
    index-url: https://pypi.python.org/simple               # Pypi Index URL
    source_builds:                                          # List of source builds
      - name: my_package_name                               # package name
        repo_type: git                                      # git and hg supported
        repo_url: git@mygithost.com:myuserid/mypackage.git  # git url here
        private: Yes                                        # private or public
        versions:
          - version: 1.0.0                                  # python version
            tag: 1.0.0                                      # git/hg branch/tag name
            dist_file: mypackage-1.0.0.tar.gz               # source dist file name

For each source build / version defined, nestegg will :

* Create a git or hg clone from the git / hg repo
* Checkout the defined tag / branch
* Create a source distribution using `python setup.py sdist`
* Publish the distribution to the nestegg package repository. 
* You can install/use the distribution using pip, easy_install etc.

All the source builds and versions you defined will be cloned, the corresponding tag checked out and source distributi

* Start nestegg server::

  $ nestegg
  Bottle v0.11.6 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
  Listening on http://0.0.0.0:7654/
  Hit Ctrl-C to quit.

Use http://localhost:7654/simple as the index url with pip or tox or other clients. eg. ::

  $ pip install SQLAlchemy==0.8.2 --index-url=http://localhost:7654 


Goals
-----

* Create a desktop / intranet mirror of all packages used. Create new test virtualenvs readily without having to wait for long downloads
* Manage versions of your package dependencies (even if pypi eventually does not publish the versions you rely upon)
* Publish versions of libraries you fork, or any you create to a pypi like repository without having to publish it globally.
* Ensure access control. Continues to work with git/hg authentication over ssh
* (TODO) Continuous / automatic integration / testing of python packages you author and maintain.
